## Testing Structure

### Backend (Flask/Python)
- Use `pytest` for unit and API endpoint tests.
- Example:
  ```bash
  pip install pytest
  pytest tests/
  ```

### Frontend (JavaScript)
- Use `Jest` (or `Mocha` for vanilla JS) for unit and DOM tests.
- Example:
  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev jest
  npx jest
  ```

### End-to-End (E2E)
- Use `Playwright` or `Cypress` for browser automation and UI regression tests.
- Example:
  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev playwright
  npx playwright test
  ```

See the `tests/` folder for examples.
